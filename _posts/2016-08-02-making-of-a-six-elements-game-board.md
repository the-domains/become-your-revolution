# Making the Celtic game board

There was a magical undertaking that I was assigned by a good friend of mine. She asked me to make her a chessboard. Sure, easy enough, but my way is never the easy way and I concocted an idea about what I would like to see in a chessboard.

The way we do things around the workshop are above and beyond and this was something I have a passion for, so I thought I would make it beyond cool.

The original plans for the design called for creating the board itself, the side pieces that would become the border, and the sides of the board, that everything would sit upon. We can't just stop there though.

The first part was to figure out the size, I was originally asked to make something about 24 inches total. However, with the amount of detail that was going to go into the board, I found that a size that is roughly 32 inches from corner to corner would be necessary, making it into a full table size. 

The entire thing would sit upon an MDF base and from that point up I would start building the perfect game board. 

Here is an image of what was designed for the side pieces:
![The sides were designed to look like a stone wall, like on a castle. The doors would be cut out and the hollow space inside the board would be used to fit drawers that would hold the pieces. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c6b2c2de-8b85-4335-a0d2-14dcaf01bb0b.png)
